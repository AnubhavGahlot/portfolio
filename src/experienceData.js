          "At the forefront of Santa Clara University's Frugal Innovation Hub, I embraced the dynamic role of a Software Developer, where my engineering prowess drove transformative results. During my tenure, I led the development of reusable React.js UI components, significantly accelerating deployment by 50% and enhancing user engagement. My expertise in React hooks, Router, Material UI, and SCSS enabled the creation of responsive applications that cut load times by 50% through effective lazy loading techniques. I orchestrated seamless end-to-end testing with Cypress, ensuring that each UI component met rigorous standards for reliability and performance. My strategic deployment on AWS-S3, coupled with React.js and Node.js, streamlined client feedback processes and bolstered communication. Additionally, my management of CI/CD with Jenkins not only automated build and deployment but also elevated operational efficiency, thereby expediting time to market. In my role, I didnâ€™t just contribute to projects; I became a linchpin in cross-functional collaborations, guiding initiatives from conception to launch. The software solutions developed under my watch were not only innovative but also timely, consistently meeting 100% of our delivery targets. I adeptly translated complex technical concepts into compelling narratives for stakeholders, securing their trust and commitment to our vision.",

        "Before my journey in Silicon Valley, I made significant strides at North Shore Technologies in India as a Senior Software Engineer. In this role, I spearheaded innovative strategies for customer acquisition, driving a notable 10% boost in conversion rates and consistently acquiring 1,000 new customers each week. My expertise extended beyond strategy to the technical realm, where I led a critical migration of our codebase from SAS to AWS using Python. This transition not only enhanced application performance by 25% but also achieved substantial cost savings. Collaborating closely with cross-functional teams, I was instrumental in modernizing our data infrastructure, including the development of a new customer portal on AWS. This initiative led to a 12% increase in customer satisfaction and a 20% improvement in clickthrough rates. I provided expert guidance on project timelines and budget management, ensuring on-time delivery while optimizing costs and enhancing customer NPS. Additionally, I played a crucial role in mentoring and supervising over three new consultants, facilitating their onboarding, transferring critical knowledge, and nurturing their growth into effective mentors. My leadership and technical acumen were key in delivering impactful solutions and fostering a collaborative work environment.",
